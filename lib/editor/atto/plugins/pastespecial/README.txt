=================

This is a plugin for Atto editor in Moodle that allows
the user to paste content from several different rich
formatting areas and either import the styling or
import as unformatted text. To install, unpack to
lib/editor/atto/plugins/pastespecial and visit the
admin notifications page to install. Then add the
button on that Atto toolbar settings page. The
pastespecial settings page can be used to configure
the allowed styles when importing formatting.
